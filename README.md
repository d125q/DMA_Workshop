# DMA Workshop

## Introduction
MD5 hash verification implemented on an LPC1769 microcontroller with
focus on throughput.  All work was done at the [Faculty of Computer
Science and Engineering](http://finki.ukim.mk/en/), [Ss. Cyril and
Methodius University](http://ukim.edu.mk/en_index.php).  The LPC1769
microcontrollers as well as tutoring were kindly provided by Bojan
Gruevski of [SEAVUS](http://www.seavus.com/).

## Requriements
You will require the
[LPCXpresso](http://www.nxp.com/products/software-and-tools/software-development-tools/software-tools/lpc-microcontroller-utilities/lpcxpresso-ide-v8.2.2:LPCXPRESSO)
IDE in order to build the code and flash it on the microcontroller.
